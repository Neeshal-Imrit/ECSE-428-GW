Feature: Assign Roles and Permissions to Users in Kanban Project Coordination System

  As an admin
  I want to assign roles and permissions to users
  So that I can control what they can access and perform

  Scenario: Admin successfully assigns a role to a user
    Given the admin is logged into the Kanban system
    And the admin navigates to the "User Management" section
    When the admin selects a user from the list
    And the admin assigns the "Project Manager" role to the user
    Then the user should have "Project Manager" permissions
    And the system should display a confirmation message "Role assigned successfully"

  # Error flow
  Scenario: Admin attempts to assign an invalid role
    Given the admin is logged into the Kanban system
    And the admin navigates to the "User Management" section
    When the admin selects a user from the list
    And the admin attempts to assign an invalid role "SuperUser"
    Then the system should display an error message "Invalid role"
    And the userâ€™s role should remain unchanged

  Scenario: Admin updates a user's permissions
    Given the admin is logged into the Kanban system
    And the admin navigates to the "User Management" section
    When the admin selects a user and updates their permissions
    And the admin clicks "Save"
    Then the system should save the updated permissions
    And the user should have the updated permissions reflected in their account
