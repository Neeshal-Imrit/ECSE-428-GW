Feature: Set Up Foundational Architecture for Full-Stack Web Application
As a developer,
I want to set up the foundational architecture for Postr,
So that I can efficiently build, test, and deliver a robust application.

Scenario: Project setup for backend and frontend
Given the developer has initiated a new project
When they set up the backend directory with Spring Boot
And they set up the frontend directory with Vue.js
And they configure the PostgreSQL database
And they create and configure the GitHub repository
Then the project should be ready for further development.

Scenario: Set up unit and acceptance testing infrastructure
Given the developer has completed the initial project setup
When they configure the unit testing infrastructure
And they run sample unit and acceptance tests
Then all tests should pass without errors.

Error Flow: Missing or incorrect environment configurations
Given the developer is setting up the environment
When the database credentials are missing or incorrect
Then the backend application should not start
And the system should display an error indicating the missing or incorrect configuration.

Error Flow: Failed project dependencies
Given the developer installs project dependencies
When a dependency is incompatible or missing
Then the system should display an error message suggesting the missing or incompatible package.
